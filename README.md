# The final project of the course **CSS Advanced @ SoftUni**


## *Long story short:*


This is a website implemented **only** with *HTML* and *SASS* using a given design. There are 3 pages which are linked together so you can access each of them easily.

At `/courses` page there is a video with cover image and a custom play button which I made **play** on click using *JavaScript*.
