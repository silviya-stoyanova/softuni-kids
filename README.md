# The final project of the course **CSS Advanced @ SoftUni**


*Long story short:*


The task is to implement a website using a given design **only** with *HTML* and *SASS*. There are 3 pages which are linked together so you can access each of them easily.

At `/courses` page there is a cover image with a play button which I made **play** on click using *JavaScript*.
